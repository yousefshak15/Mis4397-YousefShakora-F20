go through your printout and take notes on the following:

Functions and what they do.
Where each variable is first given a value.
Any variables with the same names in different parts of the program. These may be trouble later.
Any if-statements without else clauses. Are they right?
Any while-loops that might not end.
Any parts of code that you can't understand for whatever reason.
